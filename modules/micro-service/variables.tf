The `certificate` field will determine if the LB is HTTPS or not. If the field is not set, the LB will be HTTP.
The value can be an ARN or a string that matches the certificate name in the AWS Certificate Manager. If the field is a name, the duplo provider will look up the ARN for you.

The `external_port` field will determine the port that the load balancer will listen on. If the field is not set, the port will be 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS depending on weether or not the `certificate` field is set.

If the type is `target-group`, the `listener` field must be set to the ARN of the listener that the target group will be attached to.
